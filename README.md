# Open Digital Architecture Canvas

The Open Digital Architecture (ODA) Canvas is an execution environment for ODA Components and the release automation part of a CI/CD pipeline. This repository contains the reference implementation, open-source code, use-cases and compliance-test-kit for a [TMForum ODA canvas](https://www.tmforum.org/oda/deployment-runtime/oda-canvas/). 


You are free to use this as a starting point for your own ODA Canvas implementation. The [Usecase Library](usecase-library/README.md) contains the usecases that shows how ODA Components interact with the ODA Canvas. The [Compliance Test Kit](compliance-test-kit/README.md) contains details about the features required to be a fully compliant ODA Canvas and a set of compliance tests that can be used to validate your ODA Canvas. This is the reference implementation of the ODA Canvas that will be used for ODA Component certification. 

The [source code](source/README.md) contains the source code for the operators that are part of the ODA Canvas.
